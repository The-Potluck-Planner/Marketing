                    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
                    <p>We are a group of Lambda School Students with a variety of backgrounds. We came
                        together to simplify a process that should be enjoyable. Each of us are at different 
                        parts in our learning process at Lambda School. Coming together to work on a project 
                        like this helps us realize and put into perspective what a real work enviornment would
                        look and feel like.
